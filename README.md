Gonna have a crack at seeing how hard using AST context in Git diffs could be. My guess is line-based diffs get like 95% of the way there for waaaaaay less work but let's see. 

Also this is a toe in the pool for the idea of leveraging e.g. language servers to make a more language-agnistiv version of this diffing approach
